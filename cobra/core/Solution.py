    """Stores the solution from optimizing a cobra.Model.  This is
    used to provide a single interface to results from different
    solvers that store their values in different ways.

    NOTE: This class might be deprecated in favor of associating the
    values with the Reactions and Metabolites in the cobra.Model.

    f: The objective value
    
    the_time: Float.  Sometimes indicates how long it took to solve a
    problem.  As this is typically negligible and not used in cobra pie,
    it might be deprecated.
    
    the_solver: A string indicating which solver package was used.

    x: List or Array of the values from the primal.

    x_dict: A dictionary of reaction ids that maps to the primal values.

    y: List or Array of the values from the dual.

    y_dict: A dictionary of reaction ids that maps to the dual values.
